      "Summary: Elon Reeve Musk ( EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a businessman known for his key roles in Tesla, SpaceX, and Twitter (which he rebranded as X). Since 2025, he has been a senior advisor to United States president Donald Trump and the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk is the wealthiest person in the world; as of March 2025, Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$330 billion. \n",
      "Born to a wealthy family in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk emigrated in 1989 to Canada, whose citizenship he had inherited through his mother. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in the U.S. before moving to California to pursue business ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded the software company Zip2. Following its sale in 1999, he co-founded X.com, an online payment company that later merged to form PayPal, which was acquired by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. That year, Musk also became a U.S. citizen.\n",
      "In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX and became its CEO and chief engineer. The company has since led innovations in reusable rockets and commercial spaceflight. In 2004, Musk joined Tesla, Inc., as an early investor, and became its CEO and product architect in 2008; it has become a market leader in electric vehicles. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI to advance artificial intelligence research, but left its board in 2018. In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a company focused on brain–computer interfaces, and in 2017 launched the Boring Company, which aims to develop tunnel transportation. Musk was named Time magazine's Person of the Year in 2021. In 2022, he acquired Twitter, implementing significant changes and rebranding it as X in 2023. In January 2025, he was appointed head of Trump's newly created DOGE.\n",
      "Musk's political activities and views have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation and promoting conspiracy theories. His acquisition of Twitter (now X) was controversial due to a subsequent increase in hate speech and the spread of misinformation on the service. He has engaged in political activities in several countries, including as a vocal and financial supporter of Trump. Musk was the largest donor in the 2024 U.S. presidential election and is a supporter of global far-right figures, causes, and political parties.\n",

      "Page: Elon Musk salute controversy\n",
      "Summary: On January 20, 2025, while speaking at a rally celebrating U.S. president Donald Trump's second inauguration, businessman and political figure Elon Musk twice made a salute interpreted by some as a Nazi or the fascist Roman salute.\n",
      "On his own social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), Musk dismissed the accusations of Nazi sympathies, derided them as being politicized, and described them as a \"tired\" attack. The Anti-Defamation League defended Musk and argued that the gesture carried no significant meaning, but other Jewish organizations have condemned the gesture. Multiple European political parties demanded that Musk be banned from entering their countries. Neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups celebrated the salutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Views of Elon Musk\n",
      "Summary: Elon Musk is the owner of multiple companies, the wealthiest individual in the world, and a US government employee. Having rejected the conservative label, Musk has described himself as a political moderate; his views have become more right-wing over time, and have been characterized as libertarian and far-right. As the owner of Twitter, he has  suppressed critics, and after his involvement in European politics, his views have received criticism from some world leaders. Musk has also expressed his opinion on topics from science and technology to religion and philosophy.\n",
      "Within the context of American politics, Musk voted for Democratic candidates from 2008 until 2020, before switching to Republican candidates in 2022, and supporting Donald Trump in 2024 who he previously feuded with. He ha\u001b[0m\n",
